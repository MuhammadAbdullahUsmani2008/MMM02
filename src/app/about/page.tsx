                Pakistan trains excellent doctors. It has pharmaceutical manufacturing, teaching
                hospitals and a diaspora of specialists. What it does not have is a way of getting
                any of that to a village four hours from a metalled road.

                Muslim Medical Mission was formed to close that gap by the least sophisticated means

                charge nothing, we treat whoever arrives, and we record what we did so the next
                deployment is better planned than the last.
